# Amplicon-based-microbial-community-analysis-16S-and-ITS-
This repository contains the R scripts used for the downstream analysis of 16S and ITS amplicon sequencing data.   The pipeline starts from the ASV/OTU tables, taxonomy assignments, and metadata, and performs filtering, diversity analyses, ordination, differential abundance testing, and visualization.
